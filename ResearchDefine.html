    <h3>Research and Define CSS Terms</h3>
    <p><b>Specificity- </b>a ranking on css properties that will be applied to an element. </p>
    <p><b>Precedence- </b>a way to deal with mutiple style changes to a single element. Depends on the Specificity. </p>
    <p><b>Inheritance- </b>a child element would gain the properties of a parent element.</p>
    <p><b>Property- </b>define how the styles will look and where it will be placed on a wepage. </p>
    <p><b>Value- </b>a color, size, and other things given to a property to make changes to the property. </p>
    <p><b>Selector- </b>selects the content you wish to style. </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Selector and Selector Specificity</h3>
    <p><b>Element- </b> selects all elements with that specified element name.
      This is best used when specificity on the named element is not an issue such as want to change
      all the text in paragraphs a certain color or have the same hover effect for all
      links. The symbol for this is the element tag followed by curly brackets.
    </p>
    <p><b>Group- </b>groups element selectors together.
      This can be best used when you want a group of elements to have the same property.
      This is used by listing the elements and seperating them by a comma.
    </p>
    <p><b>Descendent- </b>a selector that will match all child or decendents of that specfic element.
      This is best used when you are trying to style an element within another element. this is used by listing
      the parent element first followed by a space then the child element you wish to style.
    </p>
    <p><b>Class- </b>selects elements with a specific class attribute.
      This is best used when you want specify the exact element you wish to use.
      This is used by using the period then a name of your choosing for the class.
    </p>
    <p><b>Id- </b>selector that uses an id to style a certain element with that id.
      It is best used when you want to style a certain element with a specific id.
      The symbol used for an id selector is the pound sign (#) followed by the name of the id.
    </p>
    <p><b>Universal- </b>this selector selects all of the elements.
      The best way to use this selector is to not really use it at all
      because this will select every thing but to use it as descendent selectorin certian situations might be okay.
      The symbol for this is the asterick (*).
    </p>
    <p><b>Pseudo- </b> selecter that selects an elemenet's special state and style such as hover,
      visted, active, and others. This is best used when you wish to style a element that can change states.
      This selector uses the colon symbol (:) followed by the pseudo-class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order of specificity for these selectors from least specific to most is
      unviersal, pseudo, element, group, descendent, class, and id.
